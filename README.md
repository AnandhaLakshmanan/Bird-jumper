# Bird-jumper
A 2D endless runner game inspired by Flappy Bird, developed in Python (v3.12) using Pygame and tested on Windows 10. The player guides a bird through gaps between pipes, avoiding collisions and the ground. A logging system tracks score, high score, and current screen state; see detailed logs in `game.log` in the root directory.
